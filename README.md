# Descriptive-Data-Analysis-with-Pandas
This repository features a Jupyter notebook that exemplifies the practical implementation of Descriptive Data Analysis in Python, leveraging the pandas library. The notebook includes various functions that take a tidy data format pandas DataFrame as input and provide a range of quantitative and visual descriptions of the data. The functions can handle different data types, including nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio, and generate comprehensive reports for each feature of the input DataFrame, including overall, central tendency, spread, and visual descriptions.

To validate the functions, the notebook includes several manually generated examples of data that cover a range of data types, demonstrating the functions' performance across different data types.

In conclusion, this repository presents a demonstration of Descriptive Data Analysis using Python and pandas, providing a foundation for further customization and exploration of the functions for your specific use case.
